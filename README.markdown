Neuro-Fuzzy Algorithms
======================

General
-------
This repository contains the problems, exercises, homeworks and projects developed in the graduate level course of Neuro Fuzzy Systems taught in Universidad La Salle as part of its Master in Science in Cybertronics in 2012.

Documentation
-------------
For the time being all documentation is in my mind and probably in the code. Code should be simple enough anyway.
